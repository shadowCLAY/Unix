In this challenge, the user postgres has a trivial password. 
Once you get access to this account you should be able to connect to the local PostgreSQL database by running psql

Once you gain access, you can navigate the database using:

    \list to list the databases
    \c [DATABASE] to select the database [DATABASE]
    \d to list the tables

Then you should get the key by using SELECT to find the password of the admin account.


ps -edf
su postgres
psql
\list
\c pentester
\d
select * from users;
