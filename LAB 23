In this challenge, a web application is installed in /var/www. You should be able to get credentials to connect to the database by reading some of the source code.

Once you gain access, you can read files from the file system using:

# CREATE TABLE demo(t text);
# COPY demo from '[FILENAME]';
# SELECT * FROM demo;

Where [FILENAME] is the filename.

Here, your goal is to get the key from /var/lib/postgresql/9.4/key.txt.

Once done, you can remove the table using:

# DROP TABLE demo;

This exercise highlights three issues:

    the permissions on /var/www are too weak.
    the Postgresql photoblog user has too much privileges.
    the Postgresql photoblog user has a trivial password (not that a strong password will have limit the exploitation)
