In this challenge, we are going to look into the sudo command. 
The sudo command is used to run commands as another user. 
Most of the time, it's used to give unpriviliged users the right to run command as root.

The first thing to do is to check what you can do by running the following command:

        $ sudo -l

sudo will most likely ask you for the password of the current user.

Once you executed sudo -l, you should see something similar to the following:

        $ sudo -l
        
        We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
        Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:
       #1) Respect the privacy of others.
        #2) Think before you type.
        #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
        [sudo] password for pentesterlab: 
          Matching Defaults entries for pentesterlab on 4d451a0aa68f:
        env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin
          User pentesterlab may run the following commands on 4d451a0aa68f:
          
        (victim) /bin/bash


The key information is located in the final lines: you're allowed to run the command /bin/bash as victim.
Since you can run /bin/bash, you can run any command after that. First, you can run:

          sudo -u victim /bin/bash

After running this command, you're actually running all the following commands as the user victim:

          $ id
          uid=1001(victim) gid=1001(victim) groups=1001(victim)

You should now be able to get access to the key.txt file in the home directory of the victim user.




sudo -u victim /bin/bash
cd
ls
cat key.txt
