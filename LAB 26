In this challenge, we are going to work on more privileges escalation based on misconfigurations of the sudo command. 
As before, you can use `sudo -l` to see what command you're authorized to run.

You can see that you're allowed to run the command /usr/bin/find, 
based on previous exercise on find and the argument -exec, you should be able to escalate your privileges and start a shell (/bin/bash) as the victim user. 
Once you do, you should see the key in the home directory of the victim user.

Otherwise, you can also use -exec to run the command cat on the key.txt file directly.


sudo -l
      (victim) /usr/bin/find
sudo -u victim find /home/  
sudo -u victim find /home/victim -name key.txt -exec cat {} \;
