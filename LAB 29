In this challenge, we are going to work on more privileges escalation based on misconfigurations of the sudo command. As before, you can use sudo -l to see what command you're authorized to run.

Here there are two ways to solve the challenge:

    just using the command to read the file containing the key.
    use the command to get a shell as the victim

Reading the file can be done directly by specifying the file's path on the command line after the command:

awk '{print $1}' /home/victim/key.txt

To gain a shell as the user victim, you can use the following command:

awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/bash")}'
